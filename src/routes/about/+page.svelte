			<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">The Vision</h2>
			<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
				OpenPlan3D started from a simple idea: everyone should have access to a powerful, easy-to-use floor plan editor — without paying for expensive software or creating yet another account.
			</p>
			<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				Whether you're rearranging your living room, planning a renovation, or designing a new home from scratch, OpenPlan3D gives you professional-grade tools right in your browser. Draw in 2D, visualize in 3D, furnish with real models, and export in any format you need.

		<section>
			<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">Completely Free, No Catches</h2>
			<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
				OpenPlan3D is <strong>100% free</strong>. There's no premium tier, no paywalls, no feature gating, and no signup required. Every feature is available to everyone, always.
			</p>
			<p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
				We believe design tools should be accessible to everyone — whether you're a homeowner sketching ideas, a student learning interior design, or a professional creating client presentations.
